== Public Key Authentication ==

The 'Public Key Authentication' add-on provides access to an application through a
different method that the normal login process. The add-on verifies the authenticity
of the login credentials using a public key. You may know this method from SSH
authentication using DSA public/private keys.

Place the public keys in 'config/backdoor'.

Requirements 
 * This add-on requires the PHP OpenSSL extension.
 * This is only the backdoor server. To log in you need a client. An example client
   can be downloaded from http://github.com/jasny/backdoor.
